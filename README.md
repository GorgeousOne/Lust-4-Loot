## üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Game Overview

Take the helm and steer your trusty ship through the dangerous waters of **"Lust 4 Loot"**! 
You and a friend can compete against each other to be the fastest pirate to retrieve the loot from the sea and stow it away on your pirate island. Gain an advantage by shooting your opponent with cannonballs so their booty falls back into the water. And play tactically - delivering more loot at once scores more points!

Sail, plunder, and outwit your rival in this frantic race for fortune!
